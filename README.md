## About Me
In my previous life I was an IT Support Analyst and Systems Administrator. My work primarily involved fixing computer problems for people so that they could do their jobs and looking after the IT systems that helped them do their jobs. My time doing contract IT roles has given me experience in a curious cross-section of industries, from non-profit organisations to construction firms.

I've transitioned into web development to re-introduce some challenge into my work. I've learnt that I'm at my best when coming up with creative solutions to problems. Frankly, there isn't much of a challenge in un-ticking the *Disable cached Exchange mode* box or resetting a roaming profile.

I'm looking for a Junior Developer role, and moving up from that into either full-stack web development or devops. Somewhere with people who work collaboratively to solve tricky challenges whilst having fun doing so would be an ideal fit for me.

I'm a strong supporter of non-profits and I'd love to work either for one, or at a business with a strong appetite for social good.

## Skills

#### Adaptability

Adaptability is - in my opinion - my key transferrable skill. As a Support Analyst, I was expected by my customers and colleagues to have expertise in a very large range of different technologies. For example, one particularly hectic day I went from writing Excel formulae, to diagnosing printer connectivity issues, to restoring backups, then finally to preparing media for internal use.

I consider my adaptability to be a valuable skill because it allows me to quickly pick up new concepts. I can quickly get up to speed and integrate myself into teams effortlessly.
