Call me Tom, unless you're a member of my immediate family.

## About Me
In my previous life I was an IT Support Analyst and Systems Administrator. My work primarily involved fixing computer problems for people so that they could do their jobs and looking after the IT systems that helped them do their jobs. My time doing contract IT roles has given me experience in a curious cross-section of industries, from non-profit organisations to construction firms.

I transitioned into web development last year to re-introduce some challenge into my work. I learnt that I'm at my best when coming up with creative solutions to problems. Frankly, there wasn't much of a challenge in un-ticking the *Disable cached Exchange mode* box or resetting a roaming profile.

I graduated from Makers Academy in August 2017, and have since been working as a front-end developer for Kingfisher Digital, building e-commerce web apps in Angular & React. I'm seeking a new opportunity to grow as a developer; I would ideally like the opportunity to do more back-end work alongside my current front-end work.

I'm a strong supporter of non-profits and I'd love to work either for one, or at a business with a strong appetite for social good.

## Skills

#### Adaptability

Adaptability is - in my opinion - my key transferrable skill. As a Support Analyst, I was expected by my customers and colleagues to have expertise in a very large range of different technologies. For example, one particularly hectic day I went from writing Excel formulae, to diagnosing printer connectivity issues, to restoring backups, then finally to preparing media for internal use.

I consider my adaptability to be a valuable skill because it allows me to quickly pick up new concepts. I can quickly get up to speed and integrate myself into teams effortlessly.

#### Learning

I have a strong commitment to professional development through self-led learning. I am a firm believer in continuously improving my capabilities through learning, as I believe the best software developers are not those that have a huge repository of technical knowledge to draw upon, but rather those that are capable of identifying what they need to learn in order to make the best contribution possible.

In my time at Kingfisher Digital, I taught myself Angular, SCSS, React and the redux architecture so that I could make meaningful contributions to the work my team was doing quickly (for a junior developer)! I also taught myself about the internal QA process and the tech used to help my team get new features into production rapidly.

I am always willing to learn whatever technologies or methodologies I need to excel at my work, and I pride myself on my commitment to learn.

#### Analysis

Years of working in IT support have allowed me to develop a finely-tuned instinct for analysis. I can take vague descriptions of problems or projects and turn them into creative solutions or implementations.

My eye for analysis was of great use to me during my time as an IT Support Analyst at the Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, where I identified bottlenecks in the IT department's service delivery and created automated solutions to eliminate them. It has also been very useful in my current role as a front-end developer, where I have been able to fix multiple critical bugs relatively quickly.

#### Additional Skills
- Proficient in Ruby, Javascript, Typescript, HTML5 & CSS3
